Rails -v 5.1.4

1) rails new  <file-name> --api -d postgresql

    Add

      - gem 'devise'

      - gem 'jwt'
        - Allows us to use JsonWebTokens

      - gem 'responders'
        - Gives us the ability to add a respond_to call into our
        ApplicationController, so that every controller which inherits from it
        knows to respond using JSON, which means we don't have to worry about
        rendering anything else.

    Uncomment

      - gem 'rack-cors'
        - Used to ignore browsers cors
